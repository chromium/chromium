//! - [FAQ][_faq]
//! - [Discussions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/discussions)
//!
//! ## Aspirations
//!
//! - Out of the box, users get a polished CLI experience
//!   - Including common argument behavior, help generation, suggested fixes for users, colored output, [shell completions](https://github.com/clap-rs/clap/tree/master/clap_complete), etc
//! - Flexible enough to port your existing CLI interface
//!   - However, we won't necessarily streamline support for each use case
//! - Reasonable parse performance
//! - Resilient maintainership, including
//!   - Willing to break compatibility rather than batching up breaking changes in large releases
//!   - Leverage feature flags to keep to one active branch
//!   - Being under [WG-CLI](https://github.com/rust-cli/team/) to increase the bus factor
//! - We follow semver and will wait about 6-9 months between major breaking changes
//! - We will support the last two minor Rust releases (MSRV, currently 1.70.0)
//!
//! While these aspirations can be at odds with fast build times and low binary
//! size, we will still strive to keep these reasonable for the flexibility you
//! get.  Check out the
//! [argparse-benchmarks](https://github.com/rust-cli/argparse-benchmarks-rs) for
//! CLI parsers optimized for other use cases.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! Run
//! ```console
//! $ cargo add clap --features derive
//! ```
//! *(See also [feature flag reference][_features])*
//!
//! Then define your CLI in `main.rs`:
//! ```rust
//! # #[cfg(feature = "derive")] {
#![doc = include_str!("../examples/demo.rs")]
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! And try it out:
#![doc = include_str!("../examples/demo.md")]
//!
//! See also the derive [tutorial][_derive::_tutorial] and [reference][_derive]
//!
